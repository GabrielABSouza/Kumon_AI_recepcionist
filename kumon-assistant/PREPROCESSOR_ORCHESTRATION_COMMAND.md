```

## Mandatory Tech Lead Orchestration Protocol

**TECH LEAD MUST FOLLOW TECH_LEAD_ORCHESTRATION_COMMAND.MD PROTOCOL - NO EXCEPTIONS**

### Implementation Phases Following Tech Lead Protocol

#### Phase 1: Critical Integration (Day 1)
```yaml
Execute Phase: MessagePreprocessor integration into whatsapp.py main flow
Scope: Lines 298-300 modification + error handling + fallback strategy
Validation: Must complete implementation before proceeding to Phase 2
QA Gate: Multi-agent validation (QA + Security + Code Review)
Decision Gate: User approval required before Phase 2
```

**Required Agent Delegation Sequence:**
1. **Backend Specialist**: Implement integration code in whatsapp.py
2. **QA Engineer**: Validate security integration and error handling
3. **Code Reviewer**: Security analysis and best practices validation
4. **User Decision Gate**: Present implementation for approval

#### Phase 2: Testing & Validation (Day 2)  
```yaml
Execute Phase: Comprehensive testing strategy execution
Scope: Security validation + Performance testing + Integration testing
Validation: All tests must pass before proceeding to Phase 3
QA Gate: Performance Analyst + QA Engineer validation
Decision Gate: User approval required before production deployment
```

**Required Agent Delegation Sequence:**
1. **Performance Analyst**: Latency impact assessment and optimization
2. **QA Engineer**: Execute comprehensive testing scenarios
3. **Security Specialist**: Vulnerability validation and penetration testing
4. **User Decision Gate**: Present test results for production approval

#### Phase 3: Production Deployment (Day 3)
```yaml
Execute Phase: Staged production rollout with monitoring
Scope: Feature flag deployment + monitoring + rollback preparation
Validation: Production metrics validation and stability confirmation
QA Gate: DevOps Engineer + Performance monitoring validation
Decision Gate: Final production release confirmation
```

**Required Agent Delegation Sequence:**
1. **DevOps Engineer**: Staged deployment with feature flags
2. **Performance Analyst**: Real-time monitoring and alerts setup
3. **QA Engineer**: Production validation and smoke testing
4. **User Decision Gate**: Final production release approval

## Critical Implementation Requirements from preprocessor_implementation.md

### 1. Integration Points (Section 3.1)
- **Primary**: Line 298 in `/app/api/v1/whatsapp.py` - Direct workflow call bypass
- **Secondary**: Line 187 in streaming_message_processor.py
- **Testing**: Line 657 in whatsapp.py test endpoints

### 2. Security Validation Requirements (Section 2.1)
- Input sanitization for XSS/SQL injection protection
- Rate limiting (50 messages/hour sliding window) 
- Business hours validation with auto-responses
- Authentication verification beyond webhook
- Spam detection and circuit breaker protection

### 3. Performance Targets (Section 4.2)
- **Total Response Time**: <3.08s (adds 80ms preprocessing)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: +15% improvement target
- **Error Rate**: -50% reduction from input validation
- **Resource Usage**: Optimized context preparation

### 4. Fallback Strategy (Section 3.3)
- Multi-layer error handling with graceful degradation
- Feature flag for instant rollback capability
- Circuit breaker protection for preprocessing failures
- Direct workflow bypass only in critical failure scenarios

## Quality Gates from Tech Lead Documentation

### Multi-Agent Validation Requirements
```yaml
QA Engineer: 
  - Integration testing scenarios execution
  - Security validation test cases
  - Performance regression testing methodology
  - Production readiness assessment

Security Specialist:
  - Complete vulnerability remediation validation
  - Input sanitization effectiveness testing
  - Rate limiting and DoS protection validation
  - Authentication and authorization verification

Code Reviewer:
  - Security analysis and code standards validation
  - Best practices compliance verification
  - Error handling robustness assessment
  - Code maintainability and documentation review

Performance Analyst:
  - Latency impact assessment (<80ms preprocessing)
  - Cache optimization effectiveness (+15% hit rate)
  - Resource usage optimization validation
  - Scalability impact analysis

Backend Specialist:
  - FastAPI integration correctness
  - Database operations optimization
  - API response format consistency
  - Error handling and logging implementation
```

### User Decision Gates (Mandatory)
```yaml
Gate 1 - Implementation Approval:
  Present: Integration architecture + code modifications + risk assessment
  Require: Explicit user approval before implementation
  Format: "[Implementation] **Decisão:** [Approval/Rejection]"

Gate 2 - Testing Approval:
  Present: Test results + security validation + performance metrics
  Require: Explicit user approval before production deployment
  Format: "[Testing Results] **Decisão:** [Deploy/Hold]"

Gate 3 - Production Release:
  Present: Deployment strategy + monitoring + rollback procedures
  Require: Final user approval for production release
  Format: "[Production Release] **Decisão:** [Go-Live/Abort]"
```

## Success Criteria Validation

### From preprocessor_implementation.md Requirements:
- ✅ Zero functionality regression in conversation flow
- ✅ Maintain <3s response time target (adds only 80ms)
- ✅ Preserve all existing CeciliaWorkflow capabilities  
- ✅ Ensure robust error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Close critical security vulnerability (XSS, injection, spam)
- ✅ Implement comprehensive rate limiting and business hours validation

### From Tech Lead Orchestration Requirements:
- ✅ Multi-agent validation at each phase
- ✅ User approval gates before major changes
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and quality assurance
- ✅ Safe rollback procedures and monitoring
- ✅ Clear communication and progress tracking

## Output Documentation
All progress, decisions, validations, and outcomes must be documented in **PREPROCESSOR_INTEGRATION_PROGRESS.md** following the orchestration protocol.
