# SuperClaude Command: Deep Orchestration Architecture Analysis

## Command
```bash
/analyze @core_orchestration_files.md @technical_architecture.md @project_scope.md --focus architecture --ultrathink --seq --c7 --delegate auto --wave-mode force --output orchestration_fixes.md
```

## Mission Brief
Conduct comprehensive architectural analysis of LangChain/LangGraph orchestration system to identify ALL conflicts, incompatibilities, and structural issues preventing proper system operation.

## Analysis Scope

### Primary Files for Deep Analysis
Based on `core_orchestration_files.md`:

1. **Adaptadores**
   - `/app/adapters/langchain_adapter.py`
   - `/app/services/langgraph_llm_adapter.py`

2. **ServiÃ§os**
   - `/app/services/production_llm_service.py`
   - `/app/services/langchain_rag.py`
   - `/app/core/service_factory.py`

3. **Workflows**
   - `/app/workflows/graph.py`
   - `/app/workflows/secure_conversation_workflow.py`
   - `/app/workflows/nodes.py`
   - `/app/workflows/edges.py`

4. **Estado**
   - `/app/core/state/models.py`
   - `/app/workflows/states.py`

## Analysis Method

### Phase 1: Static Code Analysis
1. **Import Graph Analysis**: Map all imports and detect circular dependencies
2. **Function Signature Validation**: Verify all function calls have matching definitions
3. **Type Consistency Check**: Validate type annotations and usage
4. **Interface Compliance**: Verify adapter implementations match expected interfaces

### Phase 2: Cross-File Dependency Analysis
1. **Service Factory Integration**: Verify all services are properly registered
2. **State Model Consistency**: Check field usage across all files
3. **Event Flow Validation**: Trace message flow through orchestration layers
4. **Error Path Analysis**: Identify failure points and recovery mechanisms

### Phase 3: Architecture Compliance Review
1. **Technical Architecture Alignment**: Compare implementation against `technical_architecture.md`
2. **Project Scope Validation**: Ensure implementation stays within `project_scope.md` boundaries
3. **Design Pattern Consistency**: Identify pattern violations and inconsistencies
4. **Integration Point Validation**: Verify service boundaries and contracts
